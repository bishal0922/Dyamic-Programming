# Graph Theory

A graph in computer science is a way to represent relationships between objects, like people or computers. It consists of dots (called nodes) connected by lines (called edges). We use graphs to solve problems like finding the shortest path between two points or figuring out how to connect everything with the least amount of effort.

Here are some common terms used in graph theory:

Node (or vertex): A single point in the graph.
Edge: A connection between two nodes in the graph.
Directed edge: An edge that has a specific direction (i.e., it goes from one node to another).
Undirected edge: An edge that has no specific direction (i.e., it connects two nodes in both directions).
Weighted edge: An edge that has a weight or cost associated with it.
Degree: The number of edges connected to a node.
Path: A sequence of nodes and edges that connect two nodes in the graph.
Cycle: A path that starts and ends at the same node.
Connected graph: A graph where there is a path between every pair of nodes.
Disconnected graph: A graph where there are at least two nodes that have no path between them.
Subgraph: A graph that is contained within another graph.
Complete graph: A graph where there is an edge between every pair of nodes.
Spanning tree: A subgraph of a connected graph that includes all of the nodes and is also a tree (i.e., it has no cycles).
Bipartite graph: A graph where the nodes can be divided into two groups, such that all the edges go between nodes in different groups.
These terms are fundamental to understanding and working with graphs, and they are used in many algorithms and applications.
