# Dynamic Programming

Dynamic programming is a technique for solving problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems and solving each subproblem only once. It is especially useful when a problem can be divided into overlapping subproblems.

In dynamic programming, the solutions to subproblems are stored in a table so that they can be reused later. This can result in significant performance improvements over other approaches that solve the same problem multiple times.

The key idea behind dynamic programming is to avoid redundant calculations by storing the solutions to subproblems in memory, and using these solutions to solve larger problems. This can be done in a bottom-up fashion, where the solutions to smaller subproblems are used to build up the solution to the original problem.

Dynamic programming is used in a wide range of applications, including optimization problems, machine learning, natural language processing, and bioinformatics. Some famous examples of dynamic programming algorithms are the knapsack problem, the longest common subsequence problem, and the shortest path problem in graphs.


## Terminologies used

Memoization: Memoization is like remembering something so you don't have to do it again.

Imagine you have a big puzzle with lots of pieces. You have to put the puzzle together many times, but it takes a long time to do it. Memoization is like keeping a picture of the puzzle once you have finished it so that next time you want to put it together, you can just look at the picture and it's much faster because you don't have to start from scratch every time.

In the same way, when you have a big math problem to solve, it can take a long time to figure out the answer. But if you remember the answer once you've solved it, then next time you need to solve the same problem, you can just remember the answer instead of doing all the work again. This makes it much faster and easier to solve the problem the second time. *shoutout gpt*
